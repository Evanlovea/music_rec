[00:12.14]Got a boy back home in Michigan
[00:13.96]And it tastes like jack when I'm kissing him
[00:15.99]So I told him that I never really liked his friends
[00:18.09]Now he's gone and he's calling me a b**ch again
[00:20.06]It's a guy that lives in a garden state
[00:21.99]And he told me we don't make it 'til we graduate
[00:24.06]So I told him the music would be worth the wait
[00:26.12]But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate
[00:28.05]I believe I believe I believe I believe
[00:30.16]That we're meant to be
[00:31.20]
[00:32.18]But jealousy jealousy jealousy jealousy

[01:04.60]And I thought that she could really be the one this time
