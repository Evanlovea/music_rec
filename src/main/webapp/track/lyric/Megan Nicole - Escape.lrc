[00:00.44]Run run run away
[00:02.61]Meet me in our hiding place
[00:05.06]Find me where we'll make our escape
[00:08.00]
[00:09.79]Come come come away
[00:12.05]We don't need them anyway
[00:14.42]Find me where we'll make our escape
[00:17.22]
[00:28.46]Slow it down
[00:31.24]
[00:32.97]Cause I can't breathe
[00:36.09]
[00:37.77]So much noise
[00:40.88]
[00:41.68]That I can't see
[00:44.78]
[00:51.82]I'm falling deep
[00:54.76]
[00:56.92]Who I am
[00:59.52]
[01:01.22]But can they see
[01:04.27]
[01:05.29]That I'm not perfect
[01:09.08]
[01:10.57]Cause I'll never be
[01:12.40]What they want me to be
[01:14.44]
[01:15.20]I have to believe
[01:16.99]That I'm good enough
[01:18.93]
[01:19.91]I need to release
[01:21.75]Somewhere I can be free
[01:24.02]
[01:24.65]And find the me
[01:25.94]I used to know
[01:28.20]So I'm going back
[01:30.26]To the place it begin
[01:32.38]
[01:33.30]Under the tree
[01:35.00]At the top of the hill
[01:36.85]
[01:37.61]We share all our dreams
[01:40.00]Or not say a word
[01:41.99]
[01:42.70]That's where I know
[01:44.20]Just who I am
[01:46.35]
[01:48.68]Stay with me
[01:51.54]
[01:53.18]Just be still
[01:56.13]
[01:57.94]Feel it on
[02:00.97]
[02:02.39]Disappear
[02:04.13]Disappear
[02:05.49]
[02:07.02]Now I'm letting go
[02:09.02]And we put on a show
[02:11.14]
[02:11.80]I finally believe
[02:13.49]That I'm good enough
[02:15.23]
[02:16.80]You made me strong
[02:18.53]To know all along
[02:21.30]I am the me
[02:22.44]I used to know
[02:24.82]So I'm going back
