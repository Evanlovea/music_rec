[00:06.33]Some legends are told
[00:08.19]Some turn to dust or to gold
[00:10.89]But you will remember me
[00:14.42]Remember me for centuries
[00:17.49]And just one mistake
[00:19.02]
[00:19.64]Is all it will take
[00:21.83]We'll go down in history
[00:25.37]Remember me for centuries
[00:28.39]
[00:36.39]Remember me for centuries
[00:39.73]Mummified my teenage dreams
[00:42.22]No it's nothing wrong with me
[00:44.72]The kids are all wrong
[00:45.89]The stories are off
[00:47.32]Heavy metal broke my heart
[00:50.32]Come on come on and let me in
[00:52.91]The bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
[00:55.22]And this is supposed to match
[00:56.89]The darkness that you felt
[00:58.26]I never meant for you to fix yourself
[01:03.48]
[01:06.40]Some legends are told
[01:08.26]Some turn to dust or to gold
[01:10.88]But you will remember me
[01:14.45]Remember me for centuries
[01:17.47]And just one mistake
[01:18.92]
[01:19.57]Is all it will take
[01:21.81]We'll go down in history
[01:25.34]Remember me for centuries
[01:28.41]
[01:36.43]Remember me for centuries
[01:38.59]And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
[01:41.92]'Cause I was only born inside my dreams
[01:44.63]Until you die for me
[01:45.96]As long as there is a light my shadow's over you
[01:48.62]'Cause I am the opposite of amnesia
[01:54.72]
[01:55.57]And you're a cherry blossom
[01:56.84]You're about to bloom
[01:58.21]You look so pretty but you're gone so soon
[02:00.93]
[02:06.23]Some legends are told
[02:08.24]Some turn to dust or to gold
[02:10.91]But you will remember me
[02:14.40]Remember me for centuries
[02:17.57]And just one mistake
[02:18.88]
[02:19.84]Is all it will take
[02:21.81]We'll go down in history
[02:25.42]Remember me for centuries
[02:28.40]
[02:36.33]Remember me for centuries
[02:39.59]We've been here forever
[02:44.39]And here's the frozen proof
[02:49.53]
[02:50.18]I could scream forever
[02:55.36]We are the poisoned youth
[03:00.65]
[03:11.91]Some legends are told
[03:13.76]Some turn to dust or to gold
[03:16.34]But you will remember me
[03:19.85]Remember me for centuries
[03:23.02]And just one mistake
[03:24.71]
[03:25.26]Is all it will take
[03:27.25]We'll go down in history
[03:30.75]Remember me for centuries
[03:33.85]
[03:38.14]We'll go down in history
[03:41.73]Remember me for centuries
