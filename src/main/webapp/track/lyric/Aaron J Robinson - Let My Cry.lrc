[00:23.25]Every time I pray
[00:25.18]I am knocking on you door
[00:28.13]With the power of ocean roar in my voice
[00:33.15]
[00:34.66]You know what I say
[00:36.73]Though my words may not be heard
[00:39.10]
[00:39.62]You heal every single wound in your grace
[00:44.92]So I speak and I sing
[00:49.89]
[00:51.01]And you heal everything
[00:55.93]

[01:33.79]For you teach me all your ways
[01:36.54]When my heart has gone astray from your voice
[01:41.77]
[01:43.19]Make me understand that my life is in your hands
[01:48.04]I am longing for your plan to be my choice
[01:53.47]So I speak and I sing
[01:58.40]
[01:59.19]And you give me everything
