[00:00.00]Dust Inside The Light (¹âÖÐµÄ³¾°£) - Florist
[00:02.45]I saw some thing glowing
[00:09.86]
[00:12.03]And then not
[00:14.35]
[00:16.98]Not a lightening bug not a street lamp gone dark
[00:29.13]
[00:31.69]Maybe if I keep waiting maybe I'll find the dark
[00:41.36]
[00:44.38]I heard water running behind the trees
[00:56.53]
[00:58.83]But there was no river no body not even a stream
[01:11.15]
[01:13.75]Maybe if I keep running maybe I can find the rain
[01:23.52]
[01:58.00]Little things
[02:01.89]Living floating around my room in my eyes
[02:10.31]
[02:12.55]The dust inside the light
[02:16.01]
[02:16.60]Speaking says
[02:18.99]Doesn't the sky look nice tonight
